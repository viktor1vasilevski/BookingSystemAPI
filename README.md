üìå Note: The booking status is sent to the frontend via SignalR. These examples show how the data flows internally, but the client receives real-time updates using WebSockets.

üõ´ How to Use (Search Tips)
Destination is a 3-letter airport/city code like:

SKP ‚Üí Skopje

BCN ‚Üí Barcelona

DXB ‚Üí Dubai

DepartureAirport is optional and used for flight searches:

CPH ‚Üí Copenhagen

OSL ‚Üí Oslo

STO ‚Üí Stockholm

If you include DepartureAirport, the system performs a HotelAndFlight search. If not, it's a HotelOnly search. If FromDate is within the next 45 days, it becomes a LastMinuteHotel search (and those bookings always return Failed).
